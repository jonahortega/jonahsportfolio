# Download Hand Model Instructions

To get a realistic hand model:

1. Visit one of these free sources:
   - Sketchfab: https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/hand-rig-a348cf6087eb4fd98a83b026593823ad
   - Or search for "free hand glb" on Sketchfab/Poly Haven

2. Download the model in GLB or GLTF format

3. Place the file in: public/models/hand.glb (or hand.gltf)

4. The app will automatically load and style it with cyberpunk theme

If the model file is not found, it will use a procedural fallback.
